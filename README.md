DancingText
-----------
DancingText was a personal project I created for my website. I didn't like how plain the site was so I fumbled around with added subtle animations. Although this may not be too subtle it is, in my opinion, a fun little animation.

How to use
----------
Simply add `dancingtext` to the class list of a given tag and all the text inside will start dancing as soon as you call `DancingText.dance()` in javascript.

Roadmap
-------
I plan to add more customization options such as how bouncy the text is, how many letters are magnified around an "origin" (right now one on each side is magnified). I may possibly add colors, support for custom fonts.
